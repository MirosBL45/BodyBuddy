      <p className="mb-4">
        This section is designed to guide individual users who want to make the
        most out of the Fitness Instructor Application. Whether you are just
        starting your fitness journey or already have some experience, this app
        can be tailored to your unique goals and lifestyle.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Getting Started</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To begin, simply create your profile and answer a few quick questions
        about yourself â€“ age, height, weight, fitness level, workout days,
        possible injuries, and dietary preferences. This information helps the
        app generate a personalized workout and nutrition plan that fits your
        needs. Donâ€™t worry if you are not sure about some answers, you can
        always update your information later as you progress.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Personalized Plans</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Once your profile is complete, the app generates a unique fitness plan
        just for you. The workouts are structured to match your current level
        and gradually increase intensity as you get stronger. Nutrition plans
        are also adjusted according to your goals â€“ whether you want to lose
        weight, build muscle, or simply stay healthy and active.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Every plan is flexible. If you miss a workout day, the app will adjust
        and keep you on track without guilt or stress. Our goal is to make
        fitness sustainable, not overwhelming.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Progress Tracking</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Individuals often struggle with motivation when they canâ€™t see progress.
        Thatâ€™s why our app allows you to track your achievements over time. From
        improved strength and endurance to changes in weight and body
        composition, youâ€™ll have a clear overview of how far youâ€™ve come. Small
        wins add up, and we make sure you can celebrate them.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Flexibility for Busy Lives</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Not everyone has the same schedule or resources. Thatâ€™s why your plan
        can be adapted to short workouts at home, full gym sessions, or a mix of
        both. You can also choose the number of training days per week, so the
        program fits into your daily routine without unnecessary stress.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Use This App?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The app is perfect for individuals who want structured guidance without
        paying for expensive personal trainers or complex diets. It is like
        having a digital coach in your pocket, available anytime, anywhere. With
        clear instructions, progress updates, and motivational tips, itâ€™s easier
        than ever to stay committed to your fitness journey.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6">
        Remember â€“ this is not just about short-term goals. Itâ€™s about building
        habits that support a healthier, happier lifestyle. Start small, stay
        consistent, and let the app guide you step by step toward your ideal
        self. ðŸ’ª
