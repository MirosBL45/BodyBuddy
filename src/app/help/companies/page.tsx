      <p className="mb-4">
        Investing in employee health and well-being is one of the smartest
        decisions a company can make. A healthy workforce is not only more
        productive but also more engaged, motivated, and loyal. The Fitness
        Instructor Application provides an accessible way for organizations to
        support their employees in building healthier habits, improving fitness,
        and managing stress.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Employee Fitness Matters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Employees who exercise regularly and take care of their health are less
        likely to experience burnout, chronic illnesses, or extended sick
        leaves. By encouraging a culture of health, companies can significantly
        reduce healthcare costs while boosting overall productivity and
        performance. Simply put â€“ healthier employees work better, focus longer,
        and bring more positive energy to the workplace.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How the App Helps Companies</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our app makes it easy for organizations to offer personalized fitness
        and nutrition plans to every employee. Each individual can set their own
        goals â€“ whether thatâ€™s improving energy, losing weight, or increasing
        strength â€“ while the company benefits from a healthier and happier team.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The app also provides flexibility. Employees can choose whether to train
        at home, at the gym, or during breaks at work. This way, no matter how
        busy the schedule, everyone has the opportunity to take care of their
        body and mind.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Benefits for the Workplace</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Improved employee focus and performance</li>
        <li>Reduced absenteeism and sick days</li>
        <li>Higher employee satisfaction and morale</li>
        <li>Stronger teamwork and workplace culture</li>
        <li>Positive employer branding â€“ showing that you care</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Creating a Culture of Health</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When companies actively support wellness initiatives, employees feel
        valued and appreciated. This leads to higher engagement and lower
        turnover. Promoting fitness in the workplace is not about forcing
        routines but about empowering people to take small, consistent steps
        toward better health. Over time, these steps translate into big
        improvements â€“ both for the employees and the company as a whole.
