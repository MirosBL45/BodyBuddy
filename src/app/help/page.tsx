        created with one main goal â€“ to make fitness and healthy living more
        accessible, personalized, and enjoyable for everyone. Whether you are a
        complete beginner looking for guidance, or an experienced athlete

        Who can use this app? Absolutely anyone. Students who want to build
        healthy habits, working professionals who donâ€™t have much time,
        athletes who need structured routines, or even people recovering from
        injuries (with doctorâ€™s approval, of course). The app is designed to be
        flexible and scalable, so it fits your lifestyle rather than forcing you
        into rigid rules.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
        The app combines modern web technologies with fitness expertise to offer
        tailored workout routines and nutrition plans. By simply answering a few
        questions about your age, weight, height, fitness level, available
        workout days, and dietary restrictions, you can receive a personalized
        plan that evolves as you progress.
