      <p className="mb-4">
        Welcome to our Fitness Instructor Application! ðŸŽ‰ This platform was
        created with one main goal â€“ to make fitness and healthy living more
        accessible, personalized, and enjoyable for everyone. Whether you are a
        complete beginner looking for guidance, or an experienced athlete
        searching for structured plans, our app adapts to your needs and helps
        you stay on track.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The app combines modern web technologies with fitness expertise to offer
        tailored workout routines and nutrition plans. By simply answering a few
        questions about your age, weight, height, fitness level, available
        workout days, and dietary restrictions, you can receive a personalized
        plan that evolves as you progress.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Why did we build this? Because we believe that staying fit shouldnâ€™t be
        complicated. Most people struggle with consistency, lack of clear
        direction, or simply donâ€™t know where to start. Our solution provides a
        structured, easy-to-follow approach that removes guesswork and motivates
        you to move forward step by step.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Who can use this app? Absolutely anyone. Students who want to build
        healthy habits, working professionals who donâ€™t have much time,
        athletes who need structured routines, or even people recovering from
        injuries (with doctorâ€™s approval, of course). The app is designed to be
        flexible and scalable, so it fits your lifestyle rather than forcing you
        into rigid rules.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition to personalized training and nutrition, we are constantly
        working on new features like habit tracking, progress analytics, and
        motivational reminders. The ultimate mission is to provide a complete
        virtual fitness companion that helps you reach your goals faster and in
        a healthier way.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This project is also a showcase of what modern web development can do.
        Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and state-of-the-art tools, it ensures
        speed, scalability, and a great user experience. We wanted to prove that
        technology and health can go hand in hand to make peopleâ€™s lives better.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Thank you for being here and trying out our application. We hope it
        helps you build a stronger body, sharper mind, and healthier habits that
        last a lifetime. ðŸš€
