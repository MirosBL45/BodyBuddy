## Project: Body Buddy â€“ AI-Powered Fitness & Nutrition App

**Body Buddy** is an AI-powered fitness application that helps users generate personalized workout and nutrition plans through natural conversation. Users talk directly to the AI assistant, which asks relevant questions about their goals, fitness level, schedule, and dietary preferences. Based on the responses, the app creates a tailored daily workout routine along with meal suggestions.

The goal of the app is to make training and healthy eating simple, engaging, and accessible for everyone through an intelligent and intuitive experience.
